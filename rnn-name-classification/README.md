## RNN In PyTorch
Implement a Recurrent Neural Net (RNN) from scratch in PyTorch!

## Description

This project is a customized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model from [the Main Repo](https://github.com/patrickloeber/pytorch-examples/tree/master/rnn-name-classification) designed to predict the country of origin for a given name. It is a "many-to-one" RNN model, where multiple input characters (the name) are processed sequentially to produce a single output (the predicted country).

The model uses the concept of sequence data processing to learn patterns and associations between names and their corresponding countries from a provided dataset.

The main goal of this customized version is to make the codebase more modular.
