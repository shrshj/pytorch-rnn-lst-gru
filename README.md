## PyTorch RNN, LSTM, and GRU Projects

This repository contains simple projects in PyTorch focused on learning and implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The main goal is to gain hands-on experience in deep learning with PyTorch while exploring these fundamental architectures.
